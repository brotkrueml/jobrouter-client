Requirements
============

The JobRouter Client |version| requires at least PHP 7.2; using the latest
version of PHP is highly recommended.

It requires the curl and json extension, which are normally enabled by default.


.. _installation.composer:

Composer
========

Simply add a dependency on ``brotkrueml/jobrouter-client`` to your project's
:file:`composer.json` file if you use `Composer <https://getcomposer.org/>`_ to
manage the dependencies of your project::

   composer require brotkrueml/jobrouter-client

This is the preferred way.
